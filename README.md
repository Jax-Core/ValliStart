## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/).
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install ValliStart by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **ValliStart** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **ValliStart**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing ValliStart.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

## Modules Setup

Now that you've installed and setup ValliStart, let's begin setting up some modules it comes with!

### Pinned Shortcuts

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **ValliStart** from the list and proceed to the **General** tab.
3. Under **Main Shortcuts** press the green button besides the `Select a file` text.
4. Select the shortcut for the application to be pinned.
5. Refresh ValliStart by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

That's all there is to it. Your shortcuts will now be visible in the pinned applications section. **Please keep in mind that you can only pin up to 5 shortcuts at a time.**
