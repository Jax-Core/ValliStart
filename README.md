* Flawless Animations
* Full-fledged Control Center
* Custom Pinned Shortcuts 
* Intergrated Media Controls
* Customizable Hotkeys
* Additional Modules like Weather Status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install ValliStart by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **ValliStart** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **ValliStart**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing ValliStart.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

## Modules Setup

Now that you've installed and setup ValliStart, let's begin setting up some modules it comes with!

### Pinned Shortcuts

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **ValliStart** from the list and proceed to the **General** tab.
3. Under **Main Shortcuts** press the green button besides the `Select a file` text.
4. Select the shortcut for the application to be pinned.
5. Refresh ValliStart by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

That's all there is to it. Your shortcuts will now be visible in the pinned applications section. **Please keep in mind that you can only pin up to 5 shortcuts at a time.**

### Media Controls

#### For Spotify:
For media controls to work with Spotify, you will have to setup and install **[Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/).** Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Open Powershell (Windows 10) or Windows Terminal (Windows 11) and run the commands that follow:
    ```
      Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/master/install.ps1" | Invoke-Expression

      spicetify

      spicetify config extensions webnowplaying.js
    ```
   **If you only want to install `webnowplaying.js` without the custom themes, use the following command:**
      ```
        spicetify config inject_css 0 replace_colors 0
      ```
2. And finally, run the following command to save and apply all your changes:
    ```
      spicetify backup apply
    ```

You can now proceed to configure media controls for Spotify. Simply follow the steps outlined below:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **ValliStart** from the list and proceed to the **Modules** tab.
3. Select the Media Control module and enable it.
4. Go to the **Media** tab and select **Spotify**
5. Ignore the alert for Spicetify(we've already installed this in the previous step) and press **confirm** on the bottom right.
6. Refresh ValliStart and your media controls for Spotify should work.

#### For Web Players:
For media controls to work with any website, you will have to install the **[WebNowPlaying Companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webnowplaying-companion/jfakgfcdgpghbbefmdfjkbdlibjgnbli) extension for your browser.** 

Once you've installed the extension, you can now proceed to configure media controls for Web Players. Simply follow the steps outlined below:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **ValliStart** from the list and proceed to the **Modules** tab.
3. Select the Media Control module and enable it.
4. Go to the **Media** tab and select **Web**
5. Ignore the alert for WebNowPlaying Companion extension(we've already installed this in the previous step) and press **confirm** on the bottom right.
6. Refresh ValliStart and your media controls for any website should work.

**The other modules, on the other hand, do not necessitate the installation of any additional applications or extensions. So, you can simply enable them using the same method as described above for the Media Controls module.**

## Custom Color Schemes

ValliStart includes 8 color scheme presets. You enable them by just selecting them within the **Color Scheme** tab. These are their names:

- Dark
- Blur
- CoreUI
- Dracula
- Amarena
- LoveLace
- Nord
- Light (If you use this, you will be facing the council)

You can also make your own custom schemes through the **Appearance** tab.
